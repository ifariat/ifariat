Hi!, my name is Ibrahim, I'm a self-taught designer and developer with a diverse skillset. I describe myself as a passionate, detail oriented, natural problem solver, quick learner and creative person.
Besides my strong design skills, I have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm comfortable building web apps with vanilla JavaScript as well as building them using front-end libraries like ReactJS.
